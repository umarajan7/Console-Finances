## Tasks

### Task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

#### * The total number of months included in the dataset.

#### * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

#### * The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
#### * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
####   * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

#### * The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

#### * The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

#### When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

####  ```text
####  Financial Analysis 
####  ----------------
####  Total Months: 86
####  Total: $38382578
####  Average Change: -2315.12
####  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
####  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
####  ```
